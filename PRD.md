8. Administrator monitors progress via the **live dashboard**.

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Must work offline; sync automatically when the network is available.
- **Security:** Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS); JWT-based authentication.
- **Scalability:** Support multiple concurrent routes and drivers.
- **Privacy Compliance:** GPS and photo data retained for ‚â§ 90 days.
- **Reliability:** GPS updates at least once every 30 seconds during active delivery.
